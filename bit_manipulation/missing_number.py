# Key Idea: XOR Properties
# The solution leverages two key properties of the XOR operation (^):

# Self-cancellation: a ^ a = 0 (a number XORed with itself is 0).
# Zero XOR: a ^ 0 = a (a number XORed with 0 is itself).
# Associativity and commutativity: The order of XOR operations doesnâ€™t matter.
